## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- desktop first workflow




### What I learned

i learned that planning out your work before hand is a very important task. my major issue was that i didnt set my mind on one work flow so i ended up with code that isnt very clean. that said this project was very helpfull in getting me started 



### Continued development

i want to continue to learn responsive design and applying a clean work flow to my design and coding process



### Useful resources


- dev ed youtube channel- he was very instrumental in reminding me basic html and css concepts from his glass website tutorial
